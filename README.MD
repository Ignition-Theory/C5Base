C5Base - A theme framework for Concrete5
========================================

The theme has been developed to be used as a foundation which can be modified and built upon. All the basic groundwork has already been covered and the theme is ready to be heavily modified and turned in to a specific project. 

As well as a solid theme that is easily modified, most blocks have one or more template overides that utilise styles and functionality provided by the theme package.

Core technologies integrated within this theme include:

Twitter Bootstrap v2
Slickmap
CSSPIE
jQuery Validation Engine
Google Webfonts
Built on HTML5 Boilerplate v3 and Initializer.
Written in LESS.
Compiled using the HTML5 Build Script & LESS.app.
