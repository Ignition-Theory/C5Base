{"name":"C5base","body":"C5Base - A theme framework for Concrete5\r\n========================================\r\n\r\n** Version 0.8.0 **\r\n\r\nThis is a theme developed specifically for the [Concrete5 CMS](http://concrete5.org). It currently requires version 5.5.0 or above.\r\n\r\nCheckout the demo at [c5base.ignitiontheory.net](http://c5base.ignitiontheory.net).\r\n\r\nThe theme has been developed to be used as a foundation which can be modified and built upon. All the basic groundwork has already been covered and the theme is ready to be heavily modified and turned in to a specific project. \r\n\r\nAs well as a solid theme that is easily modified, most blocks have one or more template overides that utilise styles and functionality provided by the theme package.\r\n\r\nCore technologies integrated within this theme include:\r\n\r\n-   [Twitter Bootstrap v2][]\r\n-   [Slickmap][]\r\n-   [CSSPIE][]\r\n-   [jQuery Validation Engine][]\r\n-   [Google Webfonts][]\r\n-\tBuilt on [HTML5 Boilerplate][] and [Initializer][].\r\n-\tWritten in [PHP][], [jQuery][] & [LESS][].\r\n-\tCompiled using the [HTML5 Build Script][] & [LESS.app][].\r\n-\tTested using [Total Validator Pro][].\r\n\r\n  [Twitter Bootstrap v2]: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html\r\n  [Slickmap]: http://astuteo.com/slickmap/\r\n  [CSSPIE]: http://css3pie.com/\r\n  [jQuery Validation Engine]: https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine\r\n  [Google Webfonts]: http://www.google.com/webfonts\r\n  [HTML5 Boilerplate]: http://html5boilerplate.com/\r\n  [Initializer]: http://www.initializr.com/\r\n  [PHP]: http://www.php.net/\r\n  [jQuery]: http://jquery.com/\r\n  [LESS]: http://lesscss.org/\r\n  [HTML5 Build Script]: http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/Build-script/\r\n  [LESS.app]: http://incident57.com/less/\r\n  [Total Validator Pro]: http://www.totalvalidator.com/tools/protool.html\r\n\r\n\r\nTheme Organisation\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe following is a breakdown of the theme structure with notes on what to modify. '[]' indicates a folder.\r\n\r\n### [] Theme Root (/themes/*theme_name*_dev)\r\n\r\nContains theme Page Types and misc files used by Concrete5 and all the folders listed below.\r\n\r\n### [] build\r\nContains the build script files and configuration. See [https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script/wiki](https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script/wiki) for more info on running the script.\r\n\r\n*Modify config/project.properties*\r\n+\tUpdate 'dir.publish' to match project name.\r\n+\tAdd custom page types to 'file.pages'.\r\n\r\n### [] css\r\nPlace compiled LESS files here. Specifically 'style.less' (style.css) as that is required by the build script when compiling the production theme.\r\n\r\n### [] elements\r\nContains page elements that are global to the site or often re-used. Files are loaded in to page type via `$this->inc()`.\r\n\r\n### [] fonts\r\nCustom font files. Custom fonts are often used to render text as Icons for easier styling. Font files are referenced in CSS using `@fontface`.\r\n\r\n### [] img\r\nAll images used within the theme. Also contains any images used within CSS frameworks. Contents are optimised in build script.\r\n\r\n### [] intermediate\r\nUsed by build script to hold files whilst compiling.\r\n\r\n### [] js\r\nAll javascript files go here. Any JS files placed directly in folder will be minified and concated by build script. JS Files in 'libs' folder will be left untouched.\r\nRemember to reference JS files in 'elements/html_foot.php' so they are called in development theme.\r\n\r\n### js/scripts.js\r\nApplication code. For any custom javascript written specifically for a project/theme.\r\n\r\n### js/plugins.js\r\njQuery Plugin javascript. Include plugin initialisers scripts and any plugins that cannot be contained in stand alone file.\r\n\r\n### [] less\r\nAll LESS files used within the theme. 'framework' contains CSS frameworks. Files prefixed with 'block_' are related to specific blocks. Files prefixed with 'theme_' are used to style theme pages and elements.\r\n\r\n### [] scripts\r\nContains any miscellaneous scripts that aren't javascript, such as '.htc'. Currently contains only 'PIE.htc' which is not yet implemented within the theme.\r\n\r\n### configurable_styles.css\r\nUsed by C5 to define configurable styles. Currently unused.\r\n\r\n### typography.less\r\nUsed by the WYSIWYG editor within C5 (TinyMCE).\r\n\r\nBuilding Production Theme\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe theme folder suffixed with '_dev' is a development theme and should only be used on a testing/development website. The dev theme uses javascript to render LESS and references individual jQuery plugins.\r\n\r\nTo create a production ready theme, use the included ANT Build Script. This script will make a copy of the development theme in the '/themes' folder and optimise the code. JS + CSS is minified and concated, images are compressed and HTML is updated with new references. 'description.txt' and 'thumbnail.png' are also swapped with their '_production' counterparts.\r\n\r\n*The script will not compile LESS files* - This must be done before running the script (see below).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Notes on the CSS\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis theme makes extensive use of LESS. Find more info about LESS at [http://lesscss.org](http://lesscss.org).\r\n\r\n### Development Theme\r\nLESS.js is used to compile LESS client side. Great during development, bad for live sites.\r\n\r\n'styles.less' is the core LESS file. It references all other LESS files via `@import`. \r\nThe only file not referenced is 'typography.less' on the themes root. This must be compiled seperately.\r\n\r\nSee the comments included in each file for more information about it's usage.\r\n\r\n### Production Theme (use Build script)\r\nThis LESS file is pre-compiled using a local App and moved to the CSS folder. \r\nLESS.app is recommended - http://incident57.com/less/ (set to compile /less/styles.less in to adjacent /CSS/ folder.)\r\nThe theme will reference the new single CSS file after compilation via the build script.\r\n\r\n### CSS Style Guide\r\nThe following are guidelines on how to write CSS to match with the rest of the code in this Theme.\r\nFollowing this guide allows code to remain consistent and easy to read. \r\n\r\nCSS should be multiline and follow the below example format.\r\n\r\ncamelCaseElementName {\r\n1.\tsize & display type\r\n2.\tlayout & positioning controls (padding, width etc.)\r\n2.\tvisual stuff (colors, fonts, backgrounds)\r\n3.\tCSS3 effects (split apart with a line between each if using vendor prefixes)\r\n}\r\n\r\nBlock Template Overrides\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Site Root Files\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n","tagline":"A theme framework for Concrete5 built on Twitter Bootstrap","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
